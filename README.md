# Frogsay

```
         FROGSAY IS A PROGRAM THAT GENERATES AN ASCII PICTURE OF A FROG
         SPOUTING A FROG TIP. FROG TIPS ARE FETCHED FROM
         HTTPS://FROG.TIPS'S API ENDPOINT.

         OFFLINE OR "ESSENTIAL" FROG TIPS ARE ALSO PROVIDED, ALLOWING
         FROGSAY TO FUNCTION WITHOUT A NETWORK CONNECTION.
